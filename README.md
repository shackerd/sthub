*"(static)-hub"* â€” Your static and config hub, simplified

This project is heavily under development and is not yet ready for production use. It is a work in progress and is subject to change.

## What is it?
A simple static file server that serves files from a directory and allows you to configure it with a simple HTTP request to `/env` path. Useful for web applications (e.g. angular applications, static websites, etc.).

It is designed to be used as a static file server for web applications, but can be used for any static file serving needs.
It is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use solution for serving static files and configuration.

## Goal

Bring simplicity to static file serving, allowing you to focus on your application rather than environments. This project aims to provide flexibility to to delivery process by allowing to remove static configuration files from the application codebase.

## Features
- Serve static files from a directory (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
- Serve environment variables (WIP)
- Serve configuration files (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

## Documentation
